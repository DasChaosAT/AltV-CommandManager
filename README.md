# AltV-CommandManager
This is a CommandManager for AltV, written in C# (Server) and Typescript (Client). Commands can be entered via Server- or Client-Console. All Commands are send to the server to be verified and to check the permission needed for the command.

## Build
To Build correctly you have to install this extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.CommandTaskRunner or use the .vsix file in the build tools.
- Client: Build the Project "Build" and follow the steps before

The builded files can be found in the folder "output" and just needed to be copied into resource-folder.
